My research is at the intersection of AI, education, psychology, and technology. Specifically, my research is centered around:

- Developing and applying educational data mining and learning analytics methods on process data to explore how learners interact with technology-based learning and assessment systems, and how these interactions relate to cognition and learning,
- Ensuring fairness in AI and data science methods used in education, and
- Assessing and supporting complex 21st-century skills (e.g., collaborative problem solving, self-regulated learning).

## Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics on Process Data

I am passionate about developing and applying educational data mining and learning analytics methods on process data to explore how learners interact with technology-based assessments and learning systems, and how the interactions are related to cognition and learning. My work often involves analyzing the wealth of process data (e.g., log files, text chats, audio, video) obtained from various types of systems, including large-scale educational assessments, intelligent tutoring systems, simulations, educational games, and virtual environments. For example, in a series of studies using data from NAEP’s digitally based assessments, we investigate test-takers’ cognitive and metacognitive processes and problem-solving strategies by integrating process data, response data, and survey questionnaire data. To uncover patterns in learner behavior and cognition, I apply advanced methods including sequence mining, feature engineering, cluster analysis, social network analysis, hidden Markov models, and visualization techniques like Sankey diagrams to make visible what is often hidden in traditional assessments. Below are select projects related to this line of work.
