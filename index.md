I am a Research Scientist at [Educational Testing Service (ETS)](https://www.ets.org/), where I conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), education, psychology, and technology as part of the [ETS Research Institute](https://www.ets.org/research.html). Prior to joining ETS, I obtained my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science in Education from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Ryan Baker](https://learninganalytics.upenn.edu/ryanbaker/) and [Dr. John Black](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/human-development/cognitive-studies-in-education/faculty/). I also hold an Ed.M. in Technology, Innovation, and Education from [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and an M.S. in Applied Statistics from [Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/). Previously, I worked as a [K-12 mathematics teacher](https://pvcics.org/) in a charter school and as an [instructional designer in an educational publisher](https://www.cheng-tsui.com/), experiences that continue to inform my research and application of AI and data science in education.

My recent research focuses on developing and applying educational data mining, learning analytics, and AI methods to study learning, cognition, and test-taking processes across diverse learning environments and large-scale assessments. My work has been featured in the [Nation’s Report Card (NAEP)](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/) and published in high-impact academic journals, including *Computers and Education*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, *Contemporary Educational Psychology*, *Journal of Computer Assisted Learning*, *Behavior Research Methods*, *Journal of Research in Science Teaching*, *Journal for Research in Mathematics Education*, and *Journal of Educational Measurement*, among others. I have received best paper awards and nominations at research conferences and have been recognized with the [Harvard Graduate School of Education Alumni Council Award for Impact in Education](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/community/alumni/alumni-council-awards#:~:text=Alumni%20Council%20Award%20for%20Impact,%2C%20national%2C%20or%20global%20levels.) and the ETS Presidential Award. My research has been generously supported by the National Science Foundation, the Institute of Education Sciences, the National Center for Education Statistics, Education Innovation and Research (Office of Elementary and Secondary Education), the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, and ETS.
